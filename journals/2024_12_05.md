# ENT NETWORKING
	- Emphasizes troubleshooting skills
	- Questions are not theory, but what you're working on
	- IPs/subnets to use in class
		- Part 1: 172.20.9.32/27
		- Part 2: 172.20.10.96/28
	- ### Setting up a new router
		- Clone centos base -> generate new MAC addresses (3rd option) -> linked clone
		- Network Options
			- Adapter 1
				- attach to: **Host-only adaptor**
				- Promiscious: allow all
				- Set a mac address
			- Adapter 2
				- Attach to Internal network
				- Adaptor type: paravirtualized-network
				- Promiscious: allow all
	- ### Setting up new hosts
		- Clone centos base -> generate mac (3rd option) -> linked clone
		- Network settings
			- Attach to: Internal network
			- Set a mac address
	- ### Assigning Router's IP
		- `sudo nmtui`
		- IPv4
			- manual
			- enp0s3: Create ip from host only network (10.20.30.255/24)
			- enp0s8: create ip from network subnet (given to you)
	- Check IP: `ip -4 a`
	- see interfaces: `ip link`
	-
	- ### DHCP service
		- Path: `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`
		- ```
		  # establishes internal network net3
		  subnet <SUBNET> netmask <MASK_ADDRESS> {
		  	option routers <ROUTER_IP>;
		      range <START_IP> <END_IP>; # just has to fit within subnet mask
		  }
		  
		  # fixed addresses
		  
		  ```
		- Verify syntax: `sudo dhcpd -t`
	- ### Bird (OSPF)
		- Path: `/etc/bird.conf`
		- Verify syntax: `sudo birdc show ospf interface`
			- `>> log`
			- `cat log | less`
		- ```
		  log syslog all;
		  router id <ENP0S3_IP>
		  
		  protocol device{
		  # intentionally left empty
		  }
		  
		  protocol kernel {
		  	ipv4 {
		      	export all;
		      };
		  }
		  
		  protocol ospf {
		  	area 0 {
		      	interface "enp0s3" {
		        		# intentionally left empty
		          };
		          interface "enp0s8" {
		          	stub;
		          };
		      };
		  }
		  ```
