# Basic Concepts
## Population, Sampling Frame, Sample
**Population** is the group of people or things you want to study. 
**Sampling Frame** are the people from the population you can get data on.
  - **Errors of Inclusion and Exclusion**
    - Inclusion: Data *not in* population *in* sampling frame
    - Exclusion: Data *in* populatin *not in* sampling frame
**Sample** is a subset of the sampling frame that you select for you study.  
  - **Sampling Error**: sample is not representative of population due to being smaller than it
    - Increase sample size or make sample proportional to population to reduce

**Non-sampling errors**: human or machine errors.

## Variable, Measurement, Data Set  
```
Data set of sample = {
    Variable = measurement  
    Variable = measurement  
    Variable = measurement  
}
```
**(Random) Variable** is an attribute of the populatoin that can be observed or measured  
    - Age, Hair colour, Weight, Horsepower, Fuel Effciency, Cost, etc.  
**Measurement/Observation** is the value of a variable
**Data set** is a set of measurements for each thing/individual in a sample or population

## Types of Variables
**Qualitative**: Descriptive qualities (labels) of something
  - **Nomial**: observations have no value
    - can't be ranked against each other
  - **Ordinal**: observations have a natural ranking
    - ex. star ratings  
    - Difference from one ordinal observation to next could vastly different things
      - `1 star -> 2 stars` means something different from `4 stars -> 5 stars`
**Quantitative**: Numbers
  - **Interval**: measurement has no "real" 0
    -  Celcius, Farenheit, and Kelvin are all measurements of temperature that have differen't meanings for 0 degrees
    -  Difference between interval measurements are the same regardless of which value you start at
       -  +20 deg C is the same increase at 0 deg and 100 deg
 - **Ratio**: measurement scale has a real zero
   - 0 grams and 0 pounds are the same thing
  
## Sampling Methods
### Random sampling/Probability sampling
Every individual has an **equal chance of being chosen**  
**Simple random sample**
    - pick people randomly until you meet your sample size
**Systemic sampling**
  - place the things/people of the sampling frame in a sequence
  - randomly choose a starting point
  - increment by a step size and choose the thing/person you land on
    - step size = population size/sample size
- stop when you return to the starting point
**Stratified sampling**
  - sample is categorized by relevant characteristics
    - ex. gender
  - things/people from sample are chosen randomly but *proportionally to group sizes*
    -  If the groups have a 3:4 ratio, the sample should match the same ratio
**Cluster sampling**
  - split the sampling frame into random groups of equal size
  - choose groups randomly to fill sample size
### Non-random sampling
Every individual **does not have and equal chance of being chosen**  
**convience sampling**  
  - picking those who are physically convient to reach out to
    - man on the street interviews
**purposive sampling**  
  - Choosing people who have expertise or knowledge on the topic
**snowball sampling**
  - Asking people to reach out to others to build your sampling set
  - pyramid scheme
**quota sampling**
  - Divide sampling frame into groups based on a characteristic
  - set a 'quota' for how many people/things from each group you need
    - should be proportional to the group sizes
  - use convience sampling to fill the quotas
    - this differs from stratified sampling, where they are chosen *randomly*
